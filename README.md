## Reinforcement_Learning

Reinforcement learning is an interesting area of Machine learning. The rough Idea is that you have an agent and an environment. 
The agent takes actions and environment gives reward based on those actions, 
The goal is to teach the agent optimal behaviour in order to maximize the reward received by the environment.

For example, have a look at the diagram. This maze represents our environment. Our purpose would be to teach the agent an optimal 
policy so that it can solve this maze. The maze will provide a reward to the agent based on the goodness of each action it takes.
Also, each action taken by agent leads it to the new state in the environment.

As you can see in the picture below, there is one space-ship. The task is to land the space-ship between the flags smoothly.
The ship has 3 throttles in it. One throttle points downward and other 2 points in the left and right direction. With the help of these, you have to control the Ship.
